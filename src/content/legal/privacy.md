We may also obtain personal data on you from other public accessible directories and sources.

### How the Company may use your personal data

The Company, as the data controller, may collect, store and use your personal data for purposes including the following:

The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, including:

- Administering or managing the Company;
- Facilitating the provision of services to or by the Company;
- Facilitating the continuation or termination of the contractual relationship between you and the Company; and
- Facilitating the transfer of funds, and administering and facilitating any other transaction, between you and one or more of the Company.

The processing is necessary for compliance with applicable legal or regulatory obligations, including:

- Verifying the identity and addresses of our customers and counterparties (and, where applicable, their beneficial owners);

In pursuance of our legitimate interests, or those of a third party to whom your personal data are disclosed, including:

- Complying with a legal, tax, accounting or regulatory obligation to which we or the third party are subject;
- Assessing and processing requests you make;
- Sending updates, information and notices or otherwise corresponding with your business with the Company;

We will only process your personal data in pursuance of our legitimate interests where we have considered that the processing is necessary and, on balance, our legitimate interests are not overridden by your legitimate interests, rights or freedoms.

The Company continues to be a data controller even though it may from time to time engage service providers and other third parties to perform certain activities on the Company's behalf.

### Sharing your personal data

We may share your personal data with our affiliates and delegates. In certain circumstances we may be legally obliged to share your personal data and other financial information with respect to your interest in the Company with relevant regulatory authorities such as the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority or the Tax Information Authority. They, in turn, may exchange this information with foreign authorities, including tax authorities and other applicable regulatory authorities.

The Company’s affiliates and delegates may process your personal data on the Company's behalf, including with our banks, accountants, auditors and lawyers which may be data controllers in their own right. The Company's services providers are generally processors acting on the instructions of the Company. Additionally, a service provider may use your personal data where this is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which it is directly subject (for example, to comply with applicable law in the area of anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing or where mandated by a court order or regulatory sanction). The service provider, in respect of this specific use of personal data, acts as a data controller.

In exceptional circumstances, we will share your personal data with regulatory, prosecuting and other governmental agencies or departments, and parties to litigation (whether pending or threatened) in any country or territory.

### Sending your personal data internationally

Due to the international nature of our business, your personal data may be transferred to jurisdictions that do not offer equivalent protection of personal data as under the Data Protection Legislation. In such cases, we will process personal data or procure that it be processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation, which may include having appropriate contractual undertakings in legal agreements with service providers who process personal data on our behalf.

### Retention and deletion of your personal data

We will keep your personal data for as long as it is required by us. For example, we may require it for our legitimate business purposes, to perform our contractual obligations, or where law or regulation obliges us to. We will generally retain your personal data throughout the lifecycle of your engagement in transactions or business with us. Some personal data will be retained after your relationship with us ends. We expect to delete your personal data (at the latest) once there is no longer any legal or regulatory requirement or legitimate business purpose for retaining your personal data.

### Automated decision-making

We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or otherwise significantly affecting you, based solely on automated processing of your personal data, unless we have considered the proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that it meets the applicable requirements under the Data Protection Legislation.

### Your rights

You have certain data protection rights, including the right to:

- Be informed about the purposes for which your personal data are processed;
- Access your personal data;
- Stop direct marketing;
- Restrict the processing of your personal data;
